#1 DEPRESSION BOT PROJECT
TUSHAR, A CSE IV YEAR MENTOR, SUPERVISED THIS PROJECT, FROM JIET JODHPUR

A Q&A SESSION WAS PRESENT IN THE BOT AND THAT WAS MY ROLE AS A PYTHON CODER/DEVELOPER IN THE GIVEN PYTHON FILE.

There are two other primary features. 1) AUDIO IDENTIFICATION 2) FACE RECOGNITION, REGARDING UNDERPROGRESS WORK

THIS PROJECT WAS UNDER THE JAIPUR MEDICAL COLLEGE. 

The purpose of this bot is to preserve young people's mental health, which is currently not good in this era. As a result, our team's motivation is to find a solution to this problem. A few of our bot's unique features that set us apart from other bots are as follows:

FACE IDENTIFICATION (ACTUAL TIME)
Voice Identification (ACTUAL TIME )
IT'S MULTILANGUAGE
